# Drivers of cooperation
Code to run the simulations for "Drivers of cooperation in social dilemmas on higher-order networks" (https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2502.09446)

### Code description
The main code to run the model is written in Julia and Python. The `scripts` and `src` folder contain the code to create the hypernetworks with tunable overlap (in python) and run the simulations (in julia).


The `manuscript_diagrams` folder contains the data files and a jupyter notebook to reproduce the diagrams from the manuscript.


For using julia, please refer to the [official website of Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/). 


The computational results presented have been achieved using the Vienna Scientific Cluster [VSC](https://vsc.ac.at/home/).
